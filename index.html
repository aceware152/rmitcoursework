          <h2>My interest in IT</h2>
          <h5>Some basic information about my intrests in IT, Sep 11, 2019</h5>
          <p>My interest in IT is rather broad. In my start-up business I use a wide variety of IT tools. From photoshop for graphic designs for making sublimated coffee cups, t-shirts and beer coolers etc. To the creation of STL files using CAD for 3D printing and CNC manufacturing, also I use cad to create DXF files for laser cutting and CNC profile cutting.
            I use programming to generate machine code for CNC as well as tinker with robotics and Arduino as a hobby.</p>
          <h4>Where it began</h4>
          <p>My interest in IT started in the early 90’s when my family purchased our first computer. It really took off when the open market was introduced, and you could buy components and do upgrades. As I was from a farming family who did not have a great amount of financial resources, I convinced my mother to allow me to do the upgrades saving 100s of dollars in technician fees. I was maybe 12 years old at the time and by the age of 15 I was an extremely efficient technician. Life happened and unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to pursue this career path.</p>

        <div class="rightcolumn">
          <h4>My experience</h4>
          <p>As I have already stated most of my experience is from the work that I do for myself in my little start-up business and my education with my certificate 4
          in programming.</p>
          <h4>Why RMIT</h4>
          <p>I don’t think there was a choice when I enrolled through Open University however if there was I would have chosen RMIT due to the fact that it would have
          been my first choice of university when I was a teenager due to the fact that it was one of the only places in Australia that you could go to learn programming
          at that time.</p>
          <h4>What I expect to learn</h4>
          <p>I expect to build a great foundation for my continuing mission to become a data scientist and work on solving real world problems with AI. I have spoken with
          providers of masters in data science and am aware that I need to add level 3 mathmatics and statistics to stodies.</p>

          <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
          <h5>My ideal job in the future, Sep 13, 2019</h5>
          <h4>Data Scientist – ASIC</h4>
          <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39919824?searchrequesttoken=cf981005-adf9-48c8-93e7-43f409c0415b&type=standout">Veiw position on seek</a>
          <h4>About the job</h4>
          <p>Gathering and analysing financial data for the ASIC would be extremely interesting. I think there would be avenues to build
          predictive models and forecast the financial world in stocks. I know that this is possible as Ray Dalio was using algorithms
          with Bridgwater Associates to outperform the stock market well before the average person had even heard of the term AI. I
          have an interest in stocks and have long considered writing programs for predicting the market however as far as I can tell
          access to the ASIC API requires payment. This would give me the opportunity to explore this avenue.</p>
          <h4>Job requirments</h4>
          <p>At minimum I would require a BA degree in Computer Science however I believe a masters in Data Science would be more beneficial
          to this role. Experience as a data analyst as well as experience in the programming languages of R and Python are preferred for
          this role. Experience in modelling data and machine learning would also be required.</p>
          <h4>My curent skills</h4>
          <p>I am only experienced in programming languages, Java, C#, JavaScript, C for embedded systems, PHP and Swift. I have limited knowledge
          of Python and Machine learning however I do wish to address this issue as soon as practical.</p>
          <h4>The Plan</h4>
          <p>•	Complete BA in Information Technology at RMIT</p>
          <p>•	Get admitted into a Masters in Data Science</p>
          <p>•	Get hired as a Junior Data Scientist and gain the experience.</p>
          <p>•	Apply for role as data scientist at ACIC</p>

          <h2>Personality profile</h2>
          <h5>Some information from tests taken, Sep 14, 2019</h5>
          <h4>Myers-Brigs Test results</h4>
          <a href="https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/personality/start.php">Test site</a>
          <p>According to the Myers-Brigs test I am an ISTJ - the Logistician. I found this an interesting exercise
          Logic has always been to me the purest of all knowledge and the pursuit of knowledge the greatest pursuit.[1]</p>
          <p>I think in forming groups I will need to be more considerate about other’s feelings. I can be extremely
          stubborn and prefer to stick to the rules where others are more creative, I think I need to be a little
          more understanding of differences.</p>
          <h4>Learning style test results</h4>
          <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Test site</a>
          <p>I am 40% Auditory, 40% tactile and 20%. [2] I Would say this is rather accurate although I read quite a lot,
          I far prefer to be hands on doing stuff to reading in a book. I also would say that the
          speaker would need to be offering new information for me to remain focused on listening although with recordings
          even if I lose focus I am paying enough attention that if something that is interesting is presented that I can
          go back and listen to that section again.
          </p>
          <p>In a team environment I think I would need to stick to oral communication as much as possible and focus on doing
          the work part of the project.
          When forming a team I think it will be important to ask people to communicate verbally and assign me tasks that are
          doing tasks not reading tasks.</p>

          <p>In the information that they were willing to give away for free I am an empathic idealist. Who enjoys thinking
          about how to make the world a better place. A structured and orderly thinker who thinks the world should be a fair
          and equitable one. [3]</p>

          <h2>The Project</h2>
          <h5>My project details, Sep 10, 2019</h5>
          <h4>Scope</h4>
          <p>A tomahawk guided missile hits its target by constantly checking its heading and adjusting course to compensate for accuracy
          losses, hitting targets with deadly accuracy from 1,600km away.</p>
          <p>The scope of this project is to create an advertising application with the same accuracy as a tomahawk. Acquiring customers
          autonomously and with pinpoint accuracy. Interfacing with various API’s such as google adds and Facebook adds, its primary
          mission will be to use intuitive algorithms to beat the market and reduce the cost per conversion for a wide variety of customers
          and industries. Make no mistake advertising is a war and we need smart weapons.</p>
          <p>This application will be of great benefit to anyone using it, as it will put them in head of their competition and will generate
          sales that they could have only dreamed of achieving prior to using this application.</p>
          <p>Facebook alone generated $16.6 billion in ad revenue for the second quarter of 2019. This is a huge market and anyone looking to get
          the edge on their competitors will be very interested in this application as a product to aid their business. The value of this
          product is in the value it returns in sales to its customers.
          </p>

          <h3>Main features</h3>
          <h4>Learning</h4>
          <p>Learning is continual and will require a small amount of finances to continually take samples that it can use to build strategy from.
          For example, the application finds that the best target group on Sunday morning a week before Christmas is young men with gift
          suggestions this does not mean that this is your target market for this product or service. If over a period of a year that this
          result was consistent then it would be almost certain that the best time to target men of that age with gift suggestions is Sunday
          morning. To have any degree of certainty about anything the application would need to take samples over an extended period, perhaps
          years.</p>
          <p>Once the AI is fully trained will have an advanced tactical advantage that it can use to generate sales for the customers of the
          application. This will generate a large financial gain for the owners of this software.
          As the data is collected the application grows and evolves its algorithm to only target the right groups of people at the right time
          with the right products. This will generate higher results for advertising dollars for the customers of this product.</p>
          <h4>Laser targeted advertising.</h4>
          <p>When a target has been identified by the application it strikes with laser precision. Using the data collected it selects the advertisement,
          the groups of people, their interests and the time of day that the advertisement will be active. This is all about people hacking, there are
          times of day / week / year when people are more likely to spend any and all information legally obtainable will be gathered.</p>
          <p>The more information that can be legally gathered and legally used to accurately target audiences the better. Example the application knows
          that a birthday for a person in a household is 4 weeks away it selectively targets the people who are close to that person with gift
          suggestions from the companies that employ our application.
          This will be achieved with customer discovery protocols all information that is available publicly and is legally able to be used will
          be employed in the targeting algorithms. Using this approach will generate more revenue.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <div class="rightcolumn">
          <h4>Reporting</h4>
          <p>Reports will be automatically generated and in a human readable language. The AI will speak like a person. Example: “I have decided to
          include people looking for a home loan in furniture advertising campaigns because our sampling indicates that people who have recently
          visited sites for home loans have been entering our funnels for furniture sales.
          Reporting will have many features including data analytics, bar graphs, push messaging and will be fully customisable for a small fee.
          By allowing customers of the product to be shown only the information they are interested in when they are interested in seeing it. As
          advances in AI and voice assistance are becoming increasingly intelligent, this system could eventually have a personal assistant that
          could be spoken to in human language and could give verbal reports of what is being achieved with the application.</p>
          <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
          <p>For the seed AI to be initialised it would need very little more than a dedicated computer with good web access. A high capacity, High speed
          hard drive with a massive database. As the seed begins to develop it will grow in a similar way to how google grew in the early days at
          Stanford, eventually the university resources were being drained to such an extent that they were asked to leave or shut the project down.
          Any system that is partly self directed and continually collecting data will eventually grow larger than its current container.
          The programming software requirements are reasonably flexible as the API’s have SDK’s in a variety of languages.</p>
          <h4>Skill Required</h4>
          <p>Reasonably advanced skill in one or more computer languages would be required to begin this task. Proficiencies in database design and a
          reasonable understanding of AI would also be of great advantage. The skill would be hard to find at all to develop this product into a
          high value application. The necessary finances for the hires required would be beyond most university students budget. Perhaps an open
          source development on git hub with contributors earning a stake in the final product could be possible. Access to the live version and
          the data collected would need to be secure as this is where the intrinsic value of the application lies.</p>
          <h4>Outcome</h4>
          <p>When this project becomes successful it will generate great value to all stake holders, customer acquisition market would be
          changed significantly for all companies that employed this technology. The landscape of marketing would be forever changed and the power
          once only available to multi million dollar corporations could be in the hands of small start-ups desperately trying to find the market
          for their product or service.</p>
